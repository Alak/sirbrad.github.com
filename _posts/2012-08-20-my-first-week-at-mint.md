So today is the start of my second week as a front-end developer working at [Mint Digital](http://mintdigital.com 'Check out Mint they're AWESOME!'). It's been awesome, and I've already learned some pretty cool stuff with command line!

Life at Mint is great. The flexible hours mean I don't have to panic if I miss my train - or if I fancy a lay in. There is an endless supply of fizzy drinks, and I'm also a made man now I have a MBP.

If you're a good fit for one of [our roles]( 'View vacancies at Mint') you would be a fool not to check us out.
