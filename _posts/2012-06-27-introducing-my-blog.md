Hey! I've been meaning to build a blog for ages now and finally found some time. This is just a quick post to say **HI**. The blog is generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll") and hosted on [Github](http://github.com/sirbrad/sirbrad.github.com) so check it out! Another cool thing is I'm using the Github API to display issues as comments. I'll elaborate more on this later when I build a much better solution. I WILL FIND A BETTER SOLUTION.
