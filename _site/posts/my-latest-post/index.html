	<h2>History</h2>

<p>As early as the 1870s, British portrait photographer Harry Pointer created a carte de visite series featuring felines posed in various situations, to which he added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal.[5]
However, the first recorded use of the term "lolcat" is from the anonymous imageboard, 4chan.[6][7][8] The word "Lolcat" is attested as early as June 2006, and</p>

<p>the domain name "LOLcats.com" was registered on June 14, 2006.[9] Their popularity was spread through usage on forums such as Something Awful.[10] The News Journal
states that "some trace the lolcats back to the site 4chan, which features bizarre cat pictures on Saturdays, or 'Caturdays'." Ikenburg adds that the images have been "slinking around the Internet for years under various labels, but they did not beco</p>

<p>me a sensation until early 2007 with the advent of I Can Has Cheezburger?"[11] The first image on "I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?" was posted on January 11, 2007, and was allegedly from the Something Awful website."[12][13] Lev Grossman of Time wrote that the olde</p>

<p>st known example "probably dates to 2006,"[14] but later corrected himself in a blog post[15] where he recapitulated the anecdotal evidence readers had sent him, placing the origin of "Caturday" and many of the images now known by a few as "lolcats" in early 2005. The domain name "caturday.com" was registered on April 30, 2005.
The term lolcat gained national media attention in the United States when it was covered by Time,[16] which wrote that non-commercialized phenomena of the sort
are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have "a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, Usenet feel to [them]".
Entertainment Weekly put them on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Da cutest distractshun of da decaid? Y, lolcats of corse! We can neber haz enuf of deez capshioned pics of cuddlie kittehs."[17] 'Lolcat' was also a runner-up under the "Most Creative" category under the American Dialect Society Word of the Year Awards, losing out to 'Googleg√§nger'.[18]</p>
