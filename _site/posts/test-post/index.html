	<p>The site provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
GitHub also operates a pastebin-style site called Gist,[4] wikis for individual repositories, and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository.
As of January 2010, GitHub is operated under the name GitHub, Inc.[5]
The software that runs GitHub was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. (previously known as Logical Awesome) developers Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner.
